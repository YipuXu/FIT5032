Section 1: Executive Summary 
This report details the strategic plan for "Mindful Movement," a bespoke web application designed for a distinguished Melbourne-based Not-for-Profit (NFP) client. The project directly confronts a critical issue within our community: the escalating rates of anxiety, stress, and social isolation among young adults aged 18-25. Our client's primary objective is to deploy an innovative digital solution that provides this vulnerable demographic with accessible, low-barrier mental health and wellbeing support, extending their impactful community service into the digital realm.

To validate the project's direction, original research was conducted into the current digital wellness market. This analysis reveals a distinct service gap. While applications like Headspace excel at providing solitary mindfulness exercises, they do not facilitate the real-world social connection crucial for wellbeing. Furthermore, general-purpose event platforms like Meetup.com and Eventbrite, while effective for discovering a wide array of public events, lack the specialized focus required for this initiative. They are not curated for mental wellness, and their open nature cannot guarantee the safe, supportive, and non-judgmental environment that is essential for our target audience. "Mindful Movement" is strategically designed to fill this niche by operating on the core principle that structured, positive social interaction through shared supportive activities is a powerful catalyst for psychological wellbeing.

The proposed solution is a responsive, dual-facing web application built on the Vue.js 3 framework. It is engineered to serve two distinct but interconnected user groups: young people seeking supportive and friendly wellness activities, and vetted community partners (such as yoga instructors, art therapists, and hiking group leaders) who offer these events. Key platform features will include a map-based discovery tool to find nearby activities, an intuitive booking system, and a personal dashboard with interactive charts, allowing users to visualise the positive correlation between their activity and their mood.

Ultimately, the primary goals of the "Mindful Movement" platform are threefold: to significantly lower the barriers for young people to engage in beneficial group activities; to foster genuine social connections in a safe and welcoming community; and to provide community partners with a streamlined platform to manage their events and reach their target audience effectively. By creating this unique digital ecosystem, the project will equip our NFP client with a critical tool to expand its reach and deepen its community impact, contributing to a healthier and more connected generation of young Melburnians.
